# Cheerlights

Display the current [Cheerlights](http://cheerlights.com) color in your Mac's menubar ðŸŽ‰

Download it [here](https://github.com/kiliankoe/Cheerlights/releases/latest).

I'm all for always having screenshots, but literally everything this app does is show a colored circle in your menubar. Nothing else. Basically this emoji ðŸ”µ, just flat ðŸ™ƒ

This app runs on OS X 10.10+.
